Notes: At this time Ledger have transitioned to LedgerLive, but have yet to release a sandbox for the development of applications outside their current array.

Also the new transition will result in manual confirmations/research of the code/pro, which means potential costs associated with launching on Ledger Live, as a decentralised blockchain, we can complete the dev, but we can not pay these commercial costs, this will need to be revisited, or another method will have to be explored (legacy chrome applications).
